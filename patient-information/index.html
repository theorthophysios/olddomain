            <h1>Patient Information</h1>
<h2 class="editable">Total Knee replacement</h2>
<h3 class="editable">What is it?</h3>

<p class="editable">Total knee replacement is usually performed for people with severely arthritic knees. It involves replacing the ends of the femur (thigh bone) and tibia (shin bone) with metal components (prostheses). A plastic spacer is commonly used in between these components. Sometimes the knee cap (patella) is re-surfaced.</p>

<h3 class="editable">How do I prepare for it?</h3>
<p class="editable">The best preparation you can do for your knee is to get it as bent, straight and as strong you can prior to surgery. This is best done under the supervision of your physiotherapist.</p>
<p class="editable"> The OrthoPhysios will take baseline measures of flexion (bending), extension (straightening), knee strength (especially quadriceps strength) and will monitor swelling and any balance issues you may have. They will design a tailored individual programme to prepare you for optimal recovery after surgery.</p>
<p class="editable"> Ensuring you are in your best general health possible and are at your best achievable weight is also very important.</p>

<h3 class="editable">What happens after surgery?</h3>
<p class="editable">There are four phases in recovery after surgery. In hospital, hospital discharge to six weeks, six weeks to three months, three months to two years.</p>

<h4 class="editable">In hospital</h4>
<p class="editable">Most people will stay in hospital for three to five days.</p>
<p class="editable"> It is common to get up walk with assistance on the afternoon of surgery or the next day. This is not an easy task and excellent preparation will give you the best chance of success.</p>
<p class="editable"> The focus in hospital is usually helping you be mobile enough to return home. This will include work to ensure your knee bends and straightens enough, is strong enough and the swelling is well managed.</p>
<p class="editable"> If you could climb stairs before your operation you will usually do this in hospital before you go home.</p>

<h4 class="editable">Hospital Discharge to Six Weeks</h4>

<p class="editable">This is the hard part and this is when your pre-operative preparation pays off.</p>
<p class="editable"> We will work with you to manage your swelling as a priority. This is very important because swollen knees are painful and it makes it hard to bend, straighten and strengthen in the presence of swelling.</p>
<p class="editable"> Your walking and balance are a high priority and getting back into some of your usual routines, hobbies and community activities can start.</p>

<h4 class="editable">Six Weeks to Three Months</h4>
<p class="editable">Now that the wounds have healed and you are walking better it is time to work on strength.</p>
<p class="editable">Your knee should be fully straight and should bend at least as far as it did before your surgery (hopefully more). Swelling will still need to be carefully monitored and managed.</p>
<p class="editable">Your usual pre-operative activities will start to become easier but there is much work to do.</p>

<h4 class="editable">Three Months to Two Years</h4>
<p class="editable">Now it is time to make the most of your new knee.</p>
<p class="editable"> We will help you work on whatever remaining issues you have.</p>
<p class="editable">For some people bending, straightening, strength, swelling, walking, or other problems may remain. This can take some time to address but if you keep at it you will continue to see improvements for up to two years and beyond.</p>

<h2 class="editable">Why knees are important as we age</h2>

<p class="editable">You possibly have never stopped to think about your knees unless you have had a problem with them.</p>
<p class="editable">When knees are sore it makes it difficult and in some instances impossible to walk down stairs safely, stand from a chair, kneel, or get up off the floor. These functions are what give us our independence and help us age with dignity. </p>
<p class="editable">Healthy knees keep us on our feet and allow for good balance and endurance while walking.</p>
<p class="editable"> At the OrthoPhysios we take a long term view of your knee health and will advise you on the best way stay on your feet.</p>

<h2 class="editable">Total Hip Replacement</h2>

<h3 class="editable">What is it?</h3>
<p class="editable">Total hip replacement is usually performed for people with severely arthritic hips. It involves replacing the head of the femur (thigh bone) and the pelvic cup/socket with metal components (prostheses). A plastic spacer is usually used in between these components.</p>

<h3 class="editable">How do I prepare for it?</h3>
<p class="editable">The best preparation you can do for your hip is to get it as strong and flexible as you can prior to surgery. This is best done under the supervision of your physiotherapist. </p>
<p class="editable">The OrthoPhysios will take baseline measures of strength, flexibility and investigate any balance or walking issues you may have. They will design a tailored individual programme to prepare you for optimal recovery after surgery. </p>
<p class="editable">Ensuring you are in your best general health possible and are at your best achievable weight is also very important.</p>

<h3 class="editable">What happens after surgery?</h3>

<p class="editable">There are four phases in recovery after surgery. In hospital, hospital discharge to six weeks, six weeks to three months, three months to two years. In all phases it will be important that you follow your surgeonâ€™s instructions to prevent the hip dislocating.</p>

<h4 class="editable">In hospital</h4>

<p class="editable">Most people will stay in hospital for three to five days. It is common to get up and walk with assistance on the afternoon of surgery or the next day. This is not an easy task and excellent preparation will give you the best chance of success. </p>
<p class="editable">The focus in hospital is usually helping you be mobile enough to return home. If you could climb stairs before your operation you will usually do this in hospital before you go home.</p>
